Part 3 - Testing

Scenario: Supermarket Self-Service Checkout
* Simulate processes of checkout in console
* Object oriented approach
* Classes
** Main
** Checkout register
** Products
** Can add but need above three

Product class is used by checkout_register
cr reads text file of products and creates product objects from it

software architecture documentation
uml - product and checkoutresister

use content managers when reading and writing data to files
- with statement
- topic 1

System must allow scanning multiple products for multiple customers
- nested loops

suggested approach
- develop products/ getting products
- validate inputs
- look at multiple customers

must document all five methods in checkout register class using th epython language comment features

Needs to access two txt files
- products - barcode,description,price
- transactions - date,product_barcode, price

Testing
- have to use python unittest framework - topic 5
- test checkout register class
- separate test module
- minimum tests
-- all getter methods of product class
-- following methods from checkout register
-- scan_item()
-- accept_payment()
-- init()

Debugging
- use pycharm debugging with at least two breakpoints
- capture at least 2 screenshots showing execution of code and include in SAD

Test Plan
- include in SAD
- At least 6 test cases and results - topic 5 video - 1:30:30
